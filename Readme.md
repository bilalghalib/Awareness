Awareness

Awareness is an app that detects media-reported car bomb events that occur in Iraq. Awarness continously monitors Twitter for discussion of a car bomb event. When an event is found, it ranks the event to see how legitimate that event is. This removes the need for a human to validate the event.

Awareness was originally created for use in an art project as shown by crushStatue.jpg.
